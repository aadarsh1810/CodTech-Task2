## Introduction
Credit card fraud is a significant problem in the financial industry. This project implements two machine learning approaches to detect fraudulent transactions:
1. Logistic Regression
2. KMeans Clustering

## Approaches

### Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for binary classification. It models the probability that a given input point belongs to a certain class.

### KMeans Clustering
KMeans is an unsupervised learning algorithm used for clustering. It partitions the data into K clusters, aiming to minimize the within-cluster variance. In this context, it is used to identify patterns that differentiate fraudulent transactions from non-fraudulent ones.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the [Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) from Kaggle. It contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. The dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions.
